# Transformer-based model for detecting ECG signal abnormalities 
This repository contains code for classifying the severity of Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE) in newborns using ECG signals. To achieve this, raw ECG signal were tokenized using a CNN and feed into transformer for classification. To check the model performance, results were evaluated using different measures.
